# 🚗 Autonomous Vehicle Object Detection System

> **A Next-Gen Computer Vision System for Smart Traffic Analysis and Road Safety.**

---

## 🌟 Overview
This project is a state-of-the-art **Autonomous Vehicle Object Detection System** designed to identify, track, and analyze road objects in real-time. By leveraging the power of **YOLOv8** and **OpenCV**, this application provides critical insights for autonomous driving systems, traffic monitoring, and smart city infrastructure.

## 🚀 Why We Built This
The future of transportation is autonomous. To achieve full autonomy, vehicles must perceive their environment with superhuman accuracy. We built this system to:
- **Enhance Road Safety**: Detect pedestrians, vehicles, and signs instantly.
- **Analyze Traffic Flow**: Count and track unique vehicles to understand traffic density.
- **Demonstrate AI Potential**: Showcase how accessible and powerful modern Computer Vision can be.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
We utilized a robust and modern technology stack to build this scalable application:

- **Core AI**: `Ultralytics YOLOv8` (State-of-the-art Object Detection & Tracking)
- **Computer Vision**: `OpenCV` (Image processing and video analysis)
- **Backend Framework**: `Flask` (Lightweight Python web server)
- **Frontend**: `HTML5`, `Bootstrap 5` (Responsive and clean UI)
- **Data Processing**: `NumPy`, `Pandas`

## ✨ Key Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Instantly identifies Cars, Pedestrians, Trucks, Buses, Traffic Lights, and more.
- **Smart Video Analysis**: Upload any driving footage to get a processed video with bounding boxes.
- **Object Tracking**: Uses sophisticated tracking algorithms to count **unique** objects rather than just raw detections.
- **Web-Compatible Output**: Automatically converts results to **WebM** for seamless browser playback.
- **Live Metrics**: Displays detailed counts of detected objects.
